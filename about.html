            <h1 class="subheading"> Early life</h1>
            <h4 class="body">Suad was born and raised in the capital city of Accra.
                Gravitating towards the arts, reading and writing stories became a common habit growing from a means of self expression into a way to connect with other people.
                This passion coupled with a firm sense of justice eventually led her to seek a career in law.

            <h1 class="subheading">Corporate career</h1>
            <h4 class="body">During law school, she started her first business, Lustre Labs. Formerly known as Shea Lustre, the artisanal skincare company was ideated during a causal stroll in school in anticipation of an annual goods market. 
                She saw the opportunity to fill what seemed to be a growing demand for affordable and accessible organic skincare products in her community. 
                After 4 years of hard work behind the scenes, Lustre Labs officially became a recognised legal entity in 2021. 
                After law school , Suad entered the high powered corporate world working as a legal aid for the renowned Ghanaian subsidiary of Tullow Oil .
                After a year,  she devoted her talents to the Legal tech startup Judy Innovative Technologies first as a legal content acquisition associate before pivoting into a more technical role.
