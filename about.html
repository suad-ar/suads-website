            <h1 class="subheading">Early life </h1>
            <h4 class="body">Suad was born and raised in the capital city of Accra.
                Growing up, the notion respected academic electives being law medicine & engineering, was a mentality that engrained from the beginning of primary school. 
               There was often a great divide between the sciences and the arts.
               Gravitating towards the arts which came naturally to her; frequent writing became more than a means of self expression but a way to connect with other people.
                Eventually, a growing fear of mathematical operations coupled with a strong sense of justice led her to seek a career in law.

            <h1 class="subheading">Corporate career </h1>
            <h4 class="body">During law school, she started her first business, Lustre Labs. Formerly known as Shea Lustre, the artisanal skincare company was ideated during a causal stroll in school in anticipation of the annual goods market. 
                She saw the opportunity to fill what seemed to be a growing demand for affordable and accessible organic skincare products in her community. 
                After 4 years of hard work behind the scenes, Lustre Labs officially became a recognised legal entity in 2021. 
                After graduating law school , Suad dove head first into the high powered corporate world working as a legal aid for the renowned Ghanaian subsidiary of Tullow Oil .
                
                After completing a mandatory one year national service,  she decided to take a break from the corporate world to evaluate her next steps.
                Her break didn’t last long as an unexpected opportunity appeared.

            <h5 class="subheading"> A LESSON IN CHANGE </h5>
           <p class="body">Opting to pivot after spending years and large sums of money in one field is not something that is always encouraged but she quickly learned that life was not linear and we must be willing to adapt not only to external changes but internal ones as well. 
            She soft launched a career in the tech space by accepting a job as a legal content associate for a technology company. 
            Appreciating the blend between technology and what she had grown up to know, Suad’s interest was piqued, and when she was offered the opportunity to start her career on the more technical side of things, she accepted.
