            <h2>Legal Insights and Research</h2>
            <p class="body">My professional journey began as a Legal Assistant at Tullow Ghana Limited, where I dove into the intricacies of the legal world. There, I honed my skills in meticulous research and data collection. My ability to dissect complex legal matters and distill them into comprehensible information became a hallmark of my work.</p>

            <h2> Strategic Social Media Management</h2>
            <p class="body">Embracing the digital age, I ventured into the realm of social media management first with an Accra based media management company called The Brands Manager before becoming a freelance professional. Working with a vast array of companies such as Polo Beach Club, Club Nineteen, Kiddie Scholars and Zero Blade curating engaging content calendars and devising social media strategies were my daily tasks.
            My creative flair allowed me to breathe life into brands' online personas, transforming mundane feeds into vibrant, interactive communities. </p>

            <h2>Tech Adventures </h2>   
            <p class="body">Recognizing the growing synergy between law and technology, I embarked on an internship journey at MEST portfolio company Judy Innovative Technologies. Here, I delved into the world of HTML, CSS, Figma, Python, and Django. These skills opened up new avenues for me to bridge the gap between legal and tech realms, paving the way for innovative solutions in the legal field.</p>
